Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.

#### 1. What is Enzyme and what are some of the methods that it provides?

    Enzyme is a testing suite for REACT, includes methods such as mount(), .find(), and Adapter()

#### 2. What is the difference between dynamic and a static routes?

#### 4. What is a migration and why would you use one?

    A migration is pretty much a set of instructions for altering the rows of a database, adding or deleting as necessary.

#### 5. Explain how to set up a route in React.

    Begin with describing the access method (get, patch, delete, etc), the routes designation ('/ending_url_piece'), and then linking it to its appropriate controller and method ('controller#handler').

#### 6. When would you use a generate resource over a generate controller?

    Generate resource adds in views and a model as well as the controller.

#### 7. Explain the difference between a controller spec and a request spec.

        A controller spec is meant to test controller logic and outputs, whereas request specs are to test the whole stack via API requests.

#### 8. Describe the React component lifecycle. What are some of the lifecycle methods?

    Component lifecycle describes the stages the component will go through when running, beginning with initialization, mounting, update, and unmounting. Some methods include willMount, didMount, componentWillUpdate and render.

#### 9. At this point in the program, what technologies/languages do you find yourself gravitating to?

    I largely prefer Ruby and Rails for the ease of use and cleaner look to the code itself. I also enjoy how organized the rails app is when created.
